### Introduction:

I am required to present a realistic photo of my future house for my building permit.  
I managed to draw the basic plan of this famous house in FreeCAD. I now need to be able to produce this realistic photo.  
After several attempts in FreeCAD I had to resort to using Blender to be able to produce this famous realistic photo.  
In order to make this work easier, I decided to make the two softwares FreeCAD and Blender interoperable.  
This interoperability is achieved thanks to the FreeCAD **Blender Importer** workbench and the Blender **FreeCAD Importer** plugin.
